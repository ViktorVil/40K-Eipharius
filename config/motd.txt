<strong>
You have recently arrived or have been contained for a time within the ice world of Eipharius, bastioned within the noble frontier systems of the Eminent Domain. Plagued by gravitic storms, the system wanders sloppily through the fringes of Imperial Space, having suffered in it's time two cosmological collisions in it's lifetime. It's rogue star is locked in a drunken dance with Pymbyle Minor, a flirtatious encounter of gravities that would take millions of years to resolve. Rich in ultra-rare metals including ancylitum and phorydnum, Eipharius has been a miner's plunder-haven for as long as it has been identified. 

Disconnected millennia ago from Terra it's inhabitants both human and xenos tragically vanished centuries prior to Imperial Colonization, the grotesque ruins of the old city reclaimed by the Lord Trader over decades with the aid of opulent benefactors. 

Messina is forever ailing and weak; it is worn out and withering. Many parts of it are crumbling, and there are some parts that are so decayed that no one dares visit them for fear of dislodging a wall or a ragged roof with no more force than the sound of footsteps. The city has always been an old place, with damp around its feet and dust in its mouth. War made this city mighty once. But war brought it to it's knees.

[TIMELINE]
Eipharius was first settled in M41. 923 by the current Lord Trader. 
Current Year: M41. 973 Standard.

You can always a-help if you are going to do something that involves bending the rules or if you'd like help with a gimmick. There's no guarantee we answer prays, but it's the best way to ask to help staff setup something interesting for you.
